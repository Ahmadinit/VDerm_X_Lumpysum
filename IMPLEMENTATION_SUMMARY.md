- [ ] Update signup API call to include role
- [ ] Create auth utility (AsyncStorage for user data)
- [ ] Update [loginScreen.tsx](VDerm-X/src/Screens/loginScreen.tsx) - Store user role locally

#### 2. Home Screen Updates (1 hour)
- [ ] Update [homeScreen.tsx](VDerm-X/src/Screens/homeScreen.tsx) - Render different UI based on user role
- [ ] User view: Chats, Appointments, Vets, Diagnosis
- [ ] Vet view: Appointments, Patients, Profile

#### 3. Appointments Screens (5-6 hours)
**For Users:**
- [ ] Create `appointmentsScreen.tsx` - List user's appointments with status badges
- [ ] Create `bookAppointmentScreen.tsx` - Form with vet picker, date, time, reason, image
- [ ] Create `appointmentDetailsScreen.tsx` - Full details, cancel option
- [ ] Install date picker: `& "$NODE18_PATH\npm.cmd" install react-native-calendars`

**For Vets:**
- [ ] Create `vetAppointmentsScreen.tsx` - Tabs: Pending/Confirmed/Completed
- [ ] Create `vetAppointmentDetailsScreen.tsx` - Approve/Reject buttons, add notes

#### 4. Chat Screens (5-6 hours)
- [ ] Create `chatsScreen.tsx` - List conversations with diagnosis preview
- [ ] Create `chatConversationScreen.tsx` - WhatsApp-style chat UI
- [ ] Add message bubbles (user/AI styling)
- [ ] Link from [diagnosticScreen.tsx](VDerm-X/src/Screens/diagnosticScreen.tsx) - "Chat about result" button
- [ ] Implement auto-scroll, loading states

#### 5. Updates to Existing Screens (2 hours)
- [ ] Update [vetsScreen.tsx](VDerm-X/src/Screens/vetsScreen.tsx) - Fetch from API (already has BASE_URL)
- [ ] Update [diagnosticScreen.tsx](VDerm-X/src/Screens/diagnosticScreen.tsx) - Add x-user-id header, link to chat
- [ ] Update [App.tsx](VDerm-X/App.tsx) - Add new screen routes

#### 6. Mobile Dependencies to Install
```bash
cd VDerm-X
& "$NODE18_PATH\npm.cmd" install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
& "$NODE18_PATH\npm.cmd" install react-native-calendars
```

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Backend Testing (Current)
1. ✅ Register user with role='user'
2. ✅ Register vet with role='vet'
3. ✅ Verify vets endpoint returns vet users
4. ⏳ Test appointment creation
5. ⏳ Test vet approval workflow
6. ⏳ Test ML prediction with auto-save
7. ⏳ Test AI chat conversation

### Mobile Testing (After Implementation)
1. Test user registration flow (user & vet signup)
2. Test appointment booking end-to-end
3. Test vet appointment approval
4. Test ML diagnosis → chat flow
5. Test chat history & context

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

### Current Status
- ✅ Backend production-ready structure
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Role-based authorization
- ⚠️ JWT can be added later (currently simple header auth)
- ⚠️ Image storage: Local (recommend cloud storage for production)

### Production Recommendations
1. **Security:**
   - Add JWT authentication (replace header-based auth)
   - Implement refresh tokens
   - Add rate limiting
   - Enable HTTPS only

2. **Storage:**
   - Move images to AWS S3 or Cloudinary
   - Implement signed URLs for secure access

3. **Notifications:**
   - Add push notifications for appointment updates
   - Email notifications when available

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Add logging service (e.g., Winston + CloudWatch)
   - Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
   - API analytics
